## General info

DEMV is a Debiaser for Multiple Variables that aims to increase Fairness in any given dataset, both binary and categorical, with one or more sensitive variables, while keeping the accuracy of the classifier as high as possible.
The main idea behind the proposed method is that to enhance the classifier’s fairness during pre-processing effectively is necessary to consider all possible combinations of the values of the sensitive variables and the label’s values for the definition of the so-called _sensitive groups_.

We approach the problem by recursively identifying all the possible groups given by combining all the values of the sensible variables with the belonging label (class). Next, for each group, we compute its expected (𝑊𝑒𝑥𝑝) and observed (𝑊𝑜𝑏𝑠) sizes and look at the ratio among these two values. If 𝑊𝑒𝑥𝑝/𝑊𝑜𝑏𝑠 = 1, it implies that the group is fully balanced. Otherwise, if the ratio is less than one, the group size is larger than expected, so we must remove an
element from the considered group accordingly to a chosen deletion strategy. Finally, if the ratio is greater than one, the group is smaller than expected, so we have to add another item accordingly to a generation strategy. For each group, we recursively repeat this balancing operation until 𝑊𝑒𝑥𝑝/𝑊𝑜𝑏𝑠 converge to one. It is worth noting that, in order to keep a high level of accuracy, the new items added to a group should be coherent in their values with the already existing ones.

## Project structure

This repository is organized as follows:
1. Useful files to create and manage the environment are listed in the main repository (requirements.txt, environment.yml). See [Replicate-Tests](#replicate-tests) for more informations.
2. The DEMV algorithm is contained within the demv.py file. This file contains all the necessary functions to generate metrics with demv and other methods.
3. The scripts used to actually generate the metrics are generatemetrics.py and getdataset.py. To replicate tests, see the [Replicate-Tests](#replicate-tests) section.
4. The data folder contains all the datasets listed in section [Datasets and methods](#datasets-and-methods).
5. The ris folder contains all the resulting metrics generated from the execution of the script.

## Datasets and methods

DEMV was tested with numerous datasets and methods. 
Please check the aforementioned paper for more information on the datasets and their preprocessing.

### Datasets

The included datasets are:


| Dataset  | Full Name | Type | Description  | Sensitive variables  |   
|---|---|---|---| ---|
| ADULT  | Adult income | Binary | The goal is to predict if a person has an income higher than 50k a year.   |  Sex, race, bachelors, hours<10 |
| COMPAS | ProPublica Recidivism | Binary | The goal is to predict if a person will recidivate in the next two years. |Sex, race, age  |
| GERMAN| German credit | Binary | The goal is to predict if a person will recidivate in the next two years. | Sex, age, investment_as_income_percentage, month |
|CMC| Contraceptive Method Choice | Multiclass | This multi-class dataset comprises 1,473 instances and ten columns about women’s contraceptive method choice. | wife_religion, wife_work, wife_edu, hus_occ |
| CRIME | Communities and Crime | Multiclass | This multi-class dataset is made of 1,994 instances by 100 attributes and contains information about the per-capita violent crimes in a community. | black_people, hisp_people, MedRent, racePctAsian |
| DRUG | Drug Usage | Multiclass | This multi-class dataset has 1,885 instances and 15 attributes about the frequency of drugs consumption. | race, gender, age, country |
| LAW | Law School Admission | Multiclass | This multi-class dataset comprises 20,694 samples by 14 attributes and contains information about the bar passage data of Law School students.| race, gender, age, fam_inc |
| PARK | Parkinson's Telemonitoring | Multiclass |  This multi-class dataset comprises 5875 items and 19 features about Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score classification. | age, sex, PPE, Shimmer |
| WINE | Wine Quality | Multiclass | This multi-class dataset comprises 6,438 instances and 13 attributes about wine quality (variable quality). The classes are four increasing values indicating quality. | alcohol, type, density, pH | 


We ran DEMV on these datasets and obtained the new metrics of fairness, according to multiple definitions (e.g., Demographic Parity).

### Methods

In order to compare the results to some existing baselines, the code also allows to run the following debiasers on the listed datasets:

1. DEMV
2. Exponentiated Gradient (eg) (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/agarwal18a/agarwal18a.pdf)
3. Grid search (grid) (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/agarwal18a/agarwal18a.pdf)
4. biased, meaning no debiaser is actually used before gathering metrics.

## Replicate tests

### Environment setup

1. **Conda users**

   Create the conda environment using the following command:

   ```shell
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

2. **Pip users**

   Create the virtual environment using the following commands:

   ```shell
   virtualenv <env_name>
   source <env_name>/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Manual setup**

   If the previous ways to not work just install the following libraries manually:

   - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
   - [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
   - [imblearn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/)

### Run script

In order to replicate those tests, once the project directory has been downloaded, please open the terminal and move to the project folder within the terminal.

Now you can type 


`python generatemetrics.py -h` 

to receive help and information on the requested parameters. Shortly put, you should provide the dataset, the method, the number of sensitive variables to consider, and optionally the classifier you want to use (it defaults to Logistic Regression).
Here is the output of the help command, which explains the parameters:

```
usage: generatemetrics.py [-h] [--classifier [CLASSIFIER]] dataset method number_of_features

Metrics generator for DEMV testing.

positional arguments:
  dataset               Required argument: Chosen dataset to generate metrics for. Availability of datasets changes according to the chosen
                        method. All available datasets are: adult, cmc, compas, crime, drugs, german, obesity, park, wine.
  method                Required argument: Chosen method to generate metrics for. Can be biased, demv, eg, grid.
  number_of_features    Required argument: Number of sensitive features in the dataset to consider, up to 4.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --classifier [CLASSIFIER]
                        Optional argument: classifier to use. Can be logistic, svc, mlp, gradient. Defaults to Logistic Regression.
```

Please note that not all datasets, given their properties, have 4 available number_of_features or can be run with any method. Please contact us if you notice some unusual error. All the testing done by us was documented in the paper.


For instance:

`python generatemetrics.py cmc biased 3 --classifier svc`

or

`python generatemetrics.py crime demv 2`

Results will then be saved in the folder "ris" inside the folder generatemetrics, according to how many sensitive variables you have chosen to consider, up to 4. In particular, the output file will have the following structure:

`ris/[number_of_features]features/metrics_[DATASET]_[METHOD]_[NUMBER_OF_FEATURES]_[CLASSIFIER].csv`

A temporary discard_eval.csv file will also be created, but can be removed at any time and will always be overwritten by the subsequent execution.
